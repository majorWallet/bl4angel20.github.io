# Local Linear Embedding, LLE

## A Dictionary Concept

- manifold : The low-dimensional manifold is a low-dimensional shape bent or twisted in a high-dimensional space.

## Fundamental Concept

- LLE is an algorithm that represents a curved or twisted structure in a high-dimensional space as a simple structure in a low-dimensional space.
- LLE is one of the manifold learnings that dimensionally reduce data of nonlinear structures.
- LLE takes out the 2D structure hidden in the 3D space and represents it as 2D data.

- Three steps in LLE
    1. Construct kNN graph
    2. Calculate the reconstruction of weights for reconstructing every point by its neighbors
    3. Use the obtained weights to embed the points in the low dimensional subspace

## Algorithm

- training data

- LLE step1: Linear regional relationship modeling, Fix the sample and find the optimal weight.

- LLE step2: Reduce the dimension of preserving relationships, Fix the weights and find the optimal location of the sample image in the low-dimensional space.

```python
from sklearn.datasets import make_swiss_roll
from sklearn.manifold import LocallyLinearEmbedding

data, color = make_swiss_roll(n_samples = 1500)

model = LocallyLinearEmbedding(n_neighbors = 12,
                              n_components = 2)

model.fit(data)
print(model.transform(data))
