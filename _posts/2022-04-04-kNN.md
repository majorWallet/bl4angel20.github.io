# kNN (k-Nearest Negihbors algorithm)

## Fundamental Concept

![img](/images/2022-04-04-kNN/kNN.png)

- kNN can be applied to both classification and regression problems.
- When classifying unknown data, the distance to the learning data is calculated to determine how the data is classified up to k points nearby, and then the data is classified by majority vote.2.

## Algorithm

1. calculating the distance of learning data from input data
2. Search for k learning data close to input data
3. Categorize input data that is not known by majority vote in the label of learning data.

## Sample Code


```python
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_moons
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

X, y = make_moons(noise = 0.3)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.3)

model = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors = 5)

model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy_score(y_pred, y_test)
```

## difference in decision boundary according to k value

- The smaller the k value, the more likely over-fitting occurs.
- Conversely, if the value of k is too large, the decision boundary cannot be accurately learned.

## points to note

- The kNN is basically not suitable for large amounts of data processing.
- High-level data is difficult to learn. This is because asymptotic assumptions of the kNN algorithm are not necessarily established in high-dimensional data.
