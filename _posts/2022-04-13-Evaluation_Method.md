# Evaluation Method

## Ways to evaluate supervised learning

- The evaluation method of supervised learning varies depending on whether it is a classification problem or a regression problem.

|분류 문제|회귀 문제|
|:--:|:--:|
|혼동 행렬(confusion matrix)|평균제곱오차(mean square error)|
|정확도(accuracy)|결정계수(coefficient of determination)|
|정밀도(precision)||
|재현율(recall)||
|F값(F1-score)||
|곡선아래면적(area under the curve, AUC)||

- Even if evaluation indicators are appropriately selected, a good model cannot be created if they are overfitting the learning data. This should be noted.

## How to evaluate classification problems


```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer

data = load_breast_cancer()

X = data.data

y = 1 - data.target

X = X[:, :10]

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

model_lor = LogisticRegression(solver = 'lbfgs')

model_lor.fit(X, y)
y_pred = model_lor.predict(X)
```

### Confusion matrix


```python
from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix

cm = confusion_matrix(y, y_pred)

print(cm)
```

    [[337  20]
     [ 30 182]]
    

||0|1|
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|0|TN|FP|
|1|FN|TP|

- TN: Properly predict real negative data as negative
- FP: Misleading prediction of true negative data as positive
- FN: Misleading prediction of true positive data as negative
- TP: Real Positive Data Predicts Positive

![img](/images/2022-04-13-Evaluation_Method/F1-score.png)

### accuracy
Percentage of total forecast results correctly predicted


```python
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

print(accuracy_score(y, y_pred))
```

    0.9121265377855887
    

### precision
The percentage of the actual positive results that you predicted was really positive


```python
from sklearn.metrics import precision_score

print(precision_score(y, y_pred))
```

    0.900990099009901
    

### recall
Percentage correctly predicted as positive as actual positive


```python
from sklearn.metrics import recall_score

print(recall_score(y, y_pred))
```

    0.8584905660377359
    

### F1-score
reflecting both precision and recall


```python
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score

print(f1_score(y, y_pred))
```

    0.8792270531400966
    

### prediction probability
Calculate the probability of being classified as 0 and the probability of being classified as 1 respectively


```python
model_lor.predict_proba(X)
```




    array([[7.67439178e-03, 9.92325608e-01],
           [2.03127465e-02, 9.79687254e-01],
           [2.34630052e-03, 9.97653699e-01],
           ...,
           [2.35208050e-02, 9.76479195e-01],
           [8.13260214e-06, 9.99991867e-01],
           [9.99572309e-01, 4.27690516e-04]])




```python
import numpy as np

y_pred2 = (model_lor.predict_proba(X)[:, 1] > 0.1).astype(np.int64)

print(confusion_matrix(y, y_pred2))
```

    [[267  90]
     [  6 206]]
    


```python
print(accuracy_score(y, y_pred2))

print(recall_score(y, y_pred2))
```

    0.8312829525483304
    0.9716981132075472
    

### ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve and AUC (area under the curve)
- The ratio of FP is set to the horizontal axis and the ratio of TP is set to the vertical axis and displayed as a graph.
- The change in the relationship between FP and TP can be seen graphically when the threshold is slightly lowered from 1 to be treated positive among the predicted probabilities.
- If the area is up to 1 and the area under the curve is close to 1, the precision is high. On the other hand, around 0.5 is not well predicted.
- **The use of ROC is recommended when dealing with unbalanced data.**

probas = model_lor.predict_proba(X)

fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(y, probas[:, 1])
```

## Evaluation method of Regression Problem


```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

from sklearn.datasets import load_boston

data = load_boston()

X = data.data[:, [5, ]]

y = data.target
```

    C:\Users\bl4an\anaconda3\lib\site-packages\sklearn\utils\deprecation.py:87: FutureWarning: Function load_boston is deprecated; `load_boston` is deprecated in 1.0 and will be removed in 1.2.
    
        The Boston housing prices dataset has an ethical problem. You can refer to
        the documentation of this function for further details.
    
        The scikit-learn maintainers therefore strongly discourage the use of this
        dataset unless the purpose of the code is to study and educate about
        ethical issues in data science and machine learning.
    
        In this special case, you can fetch the dataset from the original
        source::
    
            import pandas as pd
            import numpy as np
    
    
            data_url = "http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/datasets/boston"
            raw_df = pd.read_csv(data_url, sep="\s+", skiprows=22, header=None)

            from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing
            housing = fetch_california_housing()
    
        for the California housing dataset and::
    
            from sklearn.datasets import fetch_openml
            housing = fetch_openml(name="house_prices", as_frame=True)
    
        for the Ames housing dataset.

### mean square error

- The mean square error is averaged after calculating both the square of error between the data to be evaluated and the predicted value.
- The smaller the mean square error, the more correct the prediction is.


```python
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

print(mean_squared_error(y, y_pred))
```

    43.60055177116956
    

### coefficient of determination

- It usually appears as a value between 0.0 and 1.0.
- If the error between the predicted value and the actual data is too large, it may be expressed as a negative value.
- The closer to 1.0, the more accurately the model represents the data point.


```python
from sklearn.metrics import r2_score

print(r2_score(y, y_pred))
```

    0.48352545599133423
    

## difference between mean square error and coefficient of determination

- If the variance of the dependent variable is large, the mean square error is also large.
- The coefficient of determination may be expressed as a value between 0.0 and 1.0 without depending on the variance of the dependent variable.

## Compared to other algorithms

### difference with SVC (Support Vector Classification) and SVR (Support Vector Regression)

- SVC shall contain as few data points as possible in margin.
- SVR should contain as many data points as possible in margin.

### SVR Sample Code


```python
from sklearn.svm import SVR

model_svr_linear = SVR(C = 0.01, kernel = 'linear')

model_svr_linear.fit(X, y)
y_svr_pred = model_svr_linear.predict(X)
```


```python
%matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, ax = plt.subplots()

ax.scatter(X, y, color = 'pink', marker = 's', label = 'data set')
ax.plot(X, y_pred, color = 'blue', label = 'regression curve')
ax.plot(X, y_svr_pred, color = 'red', label = 'SVR')

ax.legend()

plt.show()
```

## Setting hyper parameter

- The learning parameter is updated with the machine learning algorithm, but the hyperparameter must be set by the user before learning.
- Failure to set appropriate hyperparameters results in poor model performance.


```python
print(mean_squared_error(y, y_svr_pred))
print(r2_score(y, y_svr_pred))
print(model_svr_linear.coef_)
print(model_svr_linear.intercept_)
```

    72.14197118147209
    0.14543531775956597
    [[1.64398]]
    [11.13520958]
    


```python
model_svr_rbf = SVR(C=1.0, kernel = 'rbf', gamma = 'auto')

model_svr_rbf.fit(X, y)
y_svr_pred = model_svr_rbf.predict(X)

print(mean_squared_error(y, y_svr_pred))
print(r2_score(y, y_svr_pred))
```

    36.42126375260171
    0.5685684051071418
    

## Over-fitting

- The phenomenon in which good prediction results are shown as learning data, but bad prediction results are shown as test data that are not used for learning is called overfitting.
- The model performance when using unknown data is called **generalization performance**.
- Even if the mean square error is small when using the learning data, the **generalization performance** is low if it is an overfitting model.


```python
train_X, test_X = X[:400], X[400:]

train_y, test_y = y[:400], y[400:]

model_svr_rbf_1 = SVR(C = 1.0, kernel = 'rbf', gamma = 'auto')
model_svr_rbf_1.fit(train_X, train_y)

test_y_pred = model_svr_rbf_1.predict(test_X)

print(mean_squared_error(test_y, test_y_pred))
print(r2_score(test_y, test_y_pred))
```

    69.16928620453004
    -1.4478345530124388
    

## Ways to prevent over-fitting

### 1. split training data and test data


```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer

data = load_breast_cancer()

X = data.data

y = data.target

from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.3)
```

#### Models that use learning data and test data to learn with SVR


```python
from sklearn.svm import SVC

model_svc = SVC(gamma = 'auto')

model_svc.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_train_pred = model_svc.predict(X_train)

y_test_pred = model_svc.predict(X_test)

from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

print(accuracy_score(y_train, y_train_pred))

print(accuracy_score(y_test, y_test_pred))
```

    1.0
    0.5906432748538012
    

#### Models that use learning data and test data to learn with RFC


```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

model_rfc = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=10)

model_rfc.fit(X_train, y_train)

y_train_pred = model_rfc.predict(X_train)

y_test_pred = model_rfc.predict(X_test)

from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

print(accuracy_score(y_train, y_train_pred))

print(accuracy_score(y_test, y_test_pred))
```

    0.9899497487437185
    0.9473684210526315
    

- Examining the accuracy of the test data can prevent the use of overfitting models.

## Cross Validation

![img](/images/2022-04-13-Evaluation_Method/cross_validation.png)


```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold

cv = KFold(5, shuffle=True)

model_rfc_1 = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=10)

print(cross_val_score(model_rfc_1, X, y, cv=cv, scoring='accuracy'))
print(cross_val_score(model_rfc_1, X, y, cv=cv, scoring='f1'))
```

    [0.97368421 0.97368421 0.99122807 0.96491228 0.92920354]
    [0.95172414 0.96341463 0.96350365 0.93959732 0.94214876]
    

## Searching hyper parameter

### greed search

![img](/images/2022-04-13-Evaluation_Method/Grid_Search.png)


```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer

data = load_breast_cancer()

X = data.data

y = 1 - data.target

X = X[:, :10]
```


```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold

cv = KFold(5, shuffle = True)

param_grid = {'max_depth' : [5, 10, 15], 'n_estimators' : [10, 20, 30]}

model_rfc_2 = RandomForestClassifier()

grid_search = GridSearchCV(model_rfc_2, param_grid, cv=cv, scoring = 'accuracy')

grid_search.fit(X, y)
```




    GridSearchCV(cv=KFold(n_splits=5, random_state=None, shuffle=True),
                 estimator=RandomForestClassifier(),
                 param_grid={'max_depth': [5, 10, 15],
                             'n_estimators': [10, 20, 30]},
                 scoring='accuracy')




```python
print(grid_search.best_score_)
print(grid_search.best_params_)
```

    0.9420276354603322
    {'max_depth': 15, 'n_estimators': 10}
