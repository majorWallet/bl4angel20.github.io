# SVM (Support Vector Machine)

## Fundamental Concept

![img](/images/2022-04-01-SVM/SVM.png)

- The decision boundaries obtained by SVM maximize margin between groups, so learn to have no points belonging to the boundaries and classify them more clearly than logistic regression.

## Algorithm

- SVM deals with the problem of binary classification of planes assuming linear and complete classification is possible.
- Maximize the margin between groups to obtain a good decision boundary to classify.

## Sample Code


```python
from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC
from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

centers = [(-1, -0.125), (0.5, 0.5)]

X, y = make_blobs(n_samples = 50, n_features = 2, centers = centers, cluster_std = 0.3)

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size = 0.3)

model = LinearSVC()

model.fit(X_train, y_train)
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
accuracy_score(y_pred, y_test)
```

## Margin and Support vector

- If the margin does not contain data, it is called hard margin.
- Allowing some data to be contained in margin is called soft margin.
- Learning data is divided into three categories.
     - data outside margin: data outside the margin based on the decision boundary
     - margin data: data for determining margin based on decision boundaries
     - data inside margin: data that are in margin or misclassified based on the boundary of the boundaries

## Hard margin and Soft margin

![img](/images/2022-04-01-SVM/soft_hard_margin.png)

- The left graph using soft margin is not affected by the fact that the learning results are far away.
- The graph on the right using hard margin is greatly influenced by the point far away.
- How much data in the margin is allowed in soft margin follows the hyperparameters set by the person himself.
